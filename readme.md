## 3D Audio Assignment 3 Submission
#### Jong Wook Kim


Hi,

In this page you can browse my implementation of VBAP.

[audio](https://github.com/jongwook/vbap/tree/master/audio) directory contains iOS App implementation,

and [audioserver](https://github.com/jongwook/vbap/tree/master/audioserver) directory contains the server implementation for Mac OS X.

The most relevant code for the actual panning calculations can be found in [VBAP.mm](https://github.com/jongwook/vbap/blob/master/audioserver/audioserver/VBAP.mm) and [DelayLine.mm](https://github.com/jongwook/vbap/blob/master/audioserver/audioserver/DelayLine.mm).
